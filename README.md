# Linuxboy (WIP)
Linuxboy is a Gameboy emulator intended for beginners to really understand how the Gameboy works and how to replicate it in code.
I try to keep a good program structure for better readability while keeping the code simple enough so that no one gets lost.
Once the emulator is finished I'll write an article explaning everything in depth for those of you who still have doubts. :smile:

*Keep in mind it may not be perfect now, but I'll do my best to polish it over time.*

## Why?
I've always wanted to learn all the secrets of low level programming and emulating seemed like the perfect place to start my journey.
So I started looking for guides or documentation of where to start and came across [this](https://github.com/avivace/awesome-gbdev) which was pretty nice at first since it
links to some amazing articles (and [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HyzD8pNlpwI)) on how the Gameboy internals work, but alot of doubts started to rise
the further I got into emulating.

It was at that point I started looking for open source Gameboy emulators to try and figure out what I was doing wrong, but man I have to tell you something,
**emulators are messy!** It was really hard for me, an emulator beginner, to understand what was going on.

Here is when the amazing idea of writing a beginner-friendly emulator came to mind, an emulator where everyone could see what's going on
behind the hood so that they can apply it to their own projects.
